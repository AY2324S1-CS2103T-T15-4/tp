### Project: Connectify
Connectify is a networking platform designed to help professionals efficiently manage their connections and enhance their networking experiences.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: In charge of the entire UI component [\#119]()
* Created and implemented the UI component for the entire project.
* Learned and familiarized myself with JavaFX  to create the UI.
* Significance: The UI is a fundamental component of the project, as it allows users to interact with the project.

* **New Feature**: Implemented `PersonPriority` [\#92]()
* Added a `PersonPriority` class to the project.
* Done by creating a `Priority `abstract class
* Significance: Priority is a fundemental feature of Connectify, as it allows users to prioritize their contacts.

* **New Feature**: Implemented `list`, `people` and `companies` [\#58]()
* Added the `list`, `people` and `companies` commands to Connectify.
* Added the relevant tests for the commands.
* Significance: The commands are a fundamental component of the project, as they allow users to view the different categories of contacts.

* **New Feature**: Implemented `editPeople` [\#57]()
* Added the editPeople command to Connectify.
* Significance: This command allows users to edit the details of their contacts.

* **New Feature**: Cleaned up the entire testing suite [\#119]()
* Cleaned up the entire testing suite, especially the storage tests.
* Significance: Testing is an fundemental component of the Project and is also a key learning outcome of CS2103T.

* **New Feature**: Implemented the 2 way asscoiation between `Person` and `Company` [\#119]()
* Implemented the 2 way association between `Person` and `Company`.
* Not only does a Company now have a list of `Person`, but a `Person` also has a reference to the `Company` they are associated with.
* Cleaned up the associated tests and command to support the new association.
* Significance: The association models the fundemental relationship between a `Person` and a `Company`, thereby allowing all the commands to behave in a more intuitive manner.

* **Project management**:
    * Handled issue creation on GitHub for certain weeks.
    * Conducted prompt and efficient issue resolution and pull request reviews.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * To be added soon

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added initial draft version of the User Guide.
        * Contributed to the standardization of the User Guide.
        * Updated the FAQs to handle commonly asked questions as a result of user testing.

    * General*
        * Migrated documentation to Markbind.

* **Team-Based Tasks**:
    * **Established the Project Notes Google Drive**: Set up a Google Drive dedicated to Project Notes, facilitating streamlined team collaboration and centralized project documentation. Play a significant role in maintaining the document and made most of the changing including features demo in every iteration.
    * **Enhanced Code Robustness through Gradle Assertions**: Implemented assertions in Gradle to bolster code robustness, contributing to the software's overall reliability.

* **Tools**:
    * **Managed SourceTree, Git, and GitHub for Version Control**: Utilized SourceTree, Git, and GitHub for revision control and code management, ensuring efficient development workflows.
    * **Used PlantUML for Diagram Creation**: Utilized PlantUML to generate diagrams for the Developer Guide so that it is more visually informative.
    * **Used CodeCov for Code Coverage**: Utilized CodeCov to track code coverage and ensure that the project meets the minimum code coverage requirements.
