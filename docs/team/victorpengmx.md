### Project: Connectify
Connectify is a networking platform designed to help professionals efficiently manage their connections and enhance their networking experiences.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Features**:
    * Added ability to sort persons by priority
        * What it does: Allows users to rank persons by their priority value
        * Justification: This feature enables users to view persons deemed more important at the top of the person list so that they can access their details more easily.
        * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It required changes to the structure of existing classes and necessitated the use of new interfaces and classes.

    * Added ability to view the list of persons associated with a company in the company card.
        * What it does: Allows users to view which persons are associated with a specific company.
        * Justification: This feature is important as it saves time for the user that would otherwise be used to search for each person individually.
        * Highlights: This enhancement requires changes to the UI and structure of the CompanyCard class.

    * Added ability to delete companies
        * What it does: Allows users to delete companies from the Connectify database.
        * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because users are now able to remove erroneous or outdated data from the database.
