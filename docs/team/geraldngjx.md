Connectify is a networking platform designed to help professionals efficiently manage their connections and enhance their networking experiences.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Created Skeleton for Company Class
* Created the skeleton code for the Company class, which serves as a fundamental component for managing company-related information. 
* Added test cases for the Company class to set the project's direction.
* Significance: Utilized parameters of type String to set the groundwork for future refactoring of the Company class according to OOP principles. Refactoring of the Company class was based off the skeleton code and test cases.

* **New Feature**: Implemented PersonList Object
* Introduced the PersonList object, following Object-Oriented Programming principles to enable companies to maintain a list of people associated with them.
* Significance: The PersonList object is a fundamental component of the project, as it allows the Company class to store contacts associated with it. The PersonList object is also a key component of the Company class, which is a fundamental component of the project.

* **New Feature**: Implemented `notePerson` Command
* Implemented the `notePerson` command, enabling users to add notes to their contacts.
* This feature allows users to store additional information about individuals, which is crucial in effective network management.
* Key contributions: Enhanced the platform's capabilities for user data organization and personalized interactions.

* **New Feature**: Implemented `noteCompany` Command

* **Project management**:
  * Managed deliverables consistently from `v1.1` to `v1.4`.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * To be added soon.

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Contributed significantly to the User Guide, covering the Quick-Start, Tutorial: Adding Your First Connection, Table of Contents, and the majority of the User Guide to create the initial draft used in the PE-D practical.
    * Updated documentation for User Guide to clarify expected behavior for `addPerson`, `deletePerson`, `notePerson`, and `noteCompany` commands in the first iteration of bug fixes after PE-D.
  * Developer Guide:
    * Updated the target user profile, value proposition and user stories. [\#12]()
    * Provide use cases for a few representative features that require multiple steps to complete. [\#14]()
    * Included some non-functional requirements (NFRs). [\#15]()
    * Define some terms in the Glossary. [\#16]()
    * Updated the implementation details of the addPerson command.

Play a significant role in maintaining the document and made most of the changing including features demo in every iteration.
  * **Enhanced Code Robustness through Gradle Assertions**: Implemented assertions in Gradle to bolster code robustness, contributing to the software's overall reliability.

* **Tools**:
  * **Proficiently Managed SourceTree, Git, and GitHub for Version Control**: Skillfully utilized SourceTree, Git, and GitHub for revision control and code management, ensuring efficient and organized development workflows.
  * **Leveraged PlantUML for Diagram Creation**: Utilized PlantUML to generate diagrams for the Developer Guide, enriching the quality of documentation and making it more visually informative.
